# Folder Synchronization 

A simple script for synchronizing the contents of a **source folder** with a **destination folder**.

## Features
- **Folder Synchronization**: Reflects all changes made in the source folder to the replica.
- **Change Detection**: Detects new, moved, modified, or deleted files in the source folder and automatically updates the destination folder accordingly.
- **Performance**: Uses **multithreading** for efficient I/O operations and **parallelism** to watch for changes
- **Logs**: Keeps a record of all logs.
